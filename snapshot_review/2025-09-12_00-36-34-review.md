- `TrackedItem`: Links to projects with cascade delete
- PostgreSQL provider with proper relationships

### Application Entry Points

**app/root.tsx** - Application root with SSR setup
- Chakra UI provider with Emotion SSR integration
- Proper meta tags and SEO setup
- Clean document structure

**app/routes/_index.tsx** - Main route (SIMPLIFIED)
- Player selection flow: `PlayerSelectionView` → `PlayerDashboardView`
- Uses `useSelectedPlayer` hook for state management
- Clean conditional rendering pattern

### Core Components

**app/components/PlayerSelectionView.tsx** - Player search interface
- Search input with debounced API calls
- Grid layout with search and results sections
- Integrates with `usePlayerSearch` hook

**app/components/PlayerDashboardView.tsx** - Main dashboard
- Content view switching (dashboard/personal-inventories)
- Uses `useContentView` hook for navigation state
- Modular content rendering

**app/components/PlayerHeader.tsx** - Header with player info
- Online/offline status indicator
- Player stats (skills, location) from BitJita API
- Navigation menu for inventory management
- Copy player ID functionality

**app/components/PersonalInventoriesView.tsx** - Inventory management
- List/Tier view toggle
- Inventory aggregation and display
- Loading states and error handling

### Hooks & State Management

**app/hooks/useSelectedPlayer.ts** - Player persistence
- localStorage integration with SSR safety
- Clean save/clear operations
- Proper error handling

### Type Definitions

**app/types/recipes.ts** - Recipe system types
- Well-defined interfaces for Item, Recipe, ProjectItem
- ProjectBreakdown with Maps for performance
- Clean separation of concerns

**app/types/inventory.ts** - Inventory system types
- BitJita API response structures
- Internal UI data structures
- Proper type mapping between external/internal

**app/types/player.ts** - Player data types
- Comprehensive player information structure
- Experience, location, and skill mapping
- API response type definitions

### Services & Business Logic

**app/services/recipe-calculator.server.ts** - Core recipe engine
- Direct BitCraft GameData JSON imports (5,724 items, 4,251 recipes)
- Recursive recipe calculation with cycle detection
- Tier-based crafting step optimization
- Memory-efficient Map-based storage

**app/services/bitcraft-parser.ts** - Data transformation
- Converts BitCraft numeric IDs to string format
- Category mapping and data normalization
- Handles both crafting and extraction recipes
- Robust parsing with null safety

**app/routes/api.recipes.calculate.ts** - Recipe API endpoint
- POST endpoint for recipe calculations
- Proper error handling and validation
- Returns breakdown data with items/recipes metadata

### Utilities

**app/utils/inventory-calculator.ts** - Inventory application logic
- Cascading inventory application (intermediates → raw materials)
- Tier substitution system
- Complex multi-pass algorithm for optimization

### Scripts & Data Management

**scripts/extract-bitcraft-data.mjs** - Data extraction utility
- Processes BitCraft GameData for browser use
- Generates TypeScript files with type safety
- Automated data pipeline

## Key Findings

### Strengths
1. **Modern Architecture**: Well-structured Remix app with proper SSR setup
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces
3. **Performance**: Map-based data structures for efficient lookups
4. **External Integration**: Clean BitJita API integration with proper error handling
5. **Data Pipeline**: Automated BitCraft GameData processing
6. **Component Architecture**: Well-separated concerns with reusable components
7. **State Management**: Clean hooks pattern with localStorage persistence

### Technical Debt & Areas for Improvement
1. **Component Complexity**: Some components could be further decomposed
2. **Error Boundaries**: Missing React error boundaries for better UX
3. **Caching Strategy**: No client-side caching for API responses
4. **Testing**: No visible test files in the codebase
5. **Documentation**: Limited inline documentation for complex algorithms

### Architecture Evolution
The application has evolved from a simple recipe calculator to a comprehensive BitCraft player management tool:
- **Phase 1**: Recipe calculation with hardcoded data
- **Phase 2**: BitCraft GameData integration
- **Phase 3**: Player inventory management with BitJita API
- **Current**: Full-featured player dashboard with inventory tracking

### Code Quality Assessment
- **Maintainability**: High - well-organized structure with clear separation
- **Scalability**: Good - modular architecture supports feature additions
- **Performance**: Good - efficient data structures and proper React patterns
- **Security**: Adequate - proper environment variable handling
- **Accessibility**: Basic - Chakra UI provides good defaults

## Recommendations

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. Add React error boundaries for better error handling
2. Implement client-side caching for BitJita API calls
3. Add comprehensive test suite (unit + integration)
4. Document complex algorithms (inventory-calculator, tier-calculation)

### Medium Term
1. Consider implementing offline support for core functionality
2. Add performance monitoring and analytics
3. Implement proper logging system
4. Add component storybook for design system

### Long Term
1. Consider migrating to Remix v3 when stable
2. Implement real-time inventory updates
3. Add collaborative features for guild management
4. Consider PWA capabilities for mobile usage
