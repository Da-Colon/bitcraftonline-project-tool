4. **Document complex algorithms** - Especially inventory-calculator and tier-substitution logic

### Medium Term
1. **Performance monitoring** - Add analytics and performance tracking
2. **Enhanced error handling** - More granular error states and recovery
3. **Offline support** - Core functionality should work offline
4. **Component storybook** - Design system documentation and testing

### Long Term
1. **Remix v3 migration** - Take advantage of new features when stable
2. **Real-time updates** - WebSocket integration for live inventory updates
3. **PWA capabilities** - Mobile-first experience with offline support
4. **Collaborative features** - Guild management and shared inventories

## Conclusion
The BitCraft Remix application has evolved into a sophisticated, well-architected inventory management system. The recent refactoring efforts have significantly improved code organization and maintainability. The integration of claim management alongside player inventories creates a comprehensive tool for BitCraft players. The codebase demonstrates excellent engineering practices with strong TypeScript usage, modular architecture, and robust external API integration.

The removal of Prisma in favor of localStorage shows pragmatic decision-making, and the component refactoring represents a major improvement in code organization. The application successfully balances feature richness with code maintainability.
